########## Getting tables to populate ############

1. userDAO -  stray '/'

2. imageDAO - table creation statement not closed ( Missing ')'  )

3. commentDAO:46 All parts of a PRIMARY KEY must be NOT NULL; if you need NULL in a key, use UNIQUE instead. 
	Found creation statement had "imageid INTEGER DEFAULT NULL" changed to "imageid INTEGER NOT NULL"

4. LikesDAO:62 - Column count doesn't match value count at row 1
	*Three values listed to be inserted but only two in the VALUES(). Adding an imageid fixed.
	"INSERT INTO Likes(email, imageid, likedate)" 
				+ "VALUES('lloyd@wayne.edu', '2020-02-06')," ----> + "VALUES('lloyd@wayne.edu', '4', '2020-02-06'),"
				
	
	
	
########## Getting sunsetfeed to populate in sunsetFeed.jsp############

1. 	(in home.jsp)	

	<li><a href="sunsetFeed.jsp">Sunset Feed</a></li>   
	
	Directs the user directly to sunsetFeed.jsp without calling the imageFeed() function. By changing it to :
	
	<li><a href="imageFeed">Sunset Feed</a></li>
	
	The click goes through the servlet which calls the imageFeed() function
	
2.  First error after that was in sunsetFeed.jsp - stating that "postdate" did not exist within the images in the list<imagefeed> it received.
	I figured out that, while we send mysql a string to store the date, dates are stored as a date object. So in imageDAO.imageFeed(), 
	
	String postdate = resultSet.getDate("postdate"); returned null
	
	but
	
	Date postDate = resultSet.getDate("postdate");
	String postdate = String.valueOf(postDate);
	
	works. We can reduce it to Date postDate = resultSet.getDate(String.valueOf(postDate));
	
	
	
##############Getting new image to save to DB  (postsunset)##########################

1. Had to change request.getParameter("url"); to  request.getParameter("imageURL"); (in ControlServlet)
	(this is the related line in the .sjp: <input type="text"   name="imageURL" placeholder="Enter Sunset URL" size="45" value="${image.url}" required>     )
	
2. timestamp could not be null error. Got time from local machine but format wasn't right for mysql. 
	Instead of fussing with it, I made timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in the createTableString in the DAO
	
3. Column 'postuser' cannot be null error
	in ControlServlet, changed:
	String postuser = request.getParameter("postuser");
	to:
	String postuser = String.valueOf(session.getAttribute("currentUser"));
	
4. Image now in DB, but result in browser is 404 JSP file [/Home.jsp] not found. 
	response.sendRedirect("Home.jsp"); should have been "home.jsp" but I changed to "imageFeed"
	I used "imageFeed" instead of "sunsetFeed.jsp" so the redirect would be routed through the servlet and populate the page with images.
